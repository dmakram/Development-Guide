# Cause / Reason
There are many people in Sudan from teens to late 30s sometimes above that age, that are graduates of Computer Science or IT, that are looking for ways to find jobs. There is an economic struggle, and a lot of people are lost, looking for ways to make a basic income, and have a lot of trouble following the traditional Study/Career paths.

## Mission

I hope to at least guide people here in Sudan to get a boost in learning from the free Resources and to begin experimenting in Web Development. I hope to show some sort of pathway so that they can at least try to follow and get an entire level job if not a basic income.

#### About Me

I am a Freelancer and I have seen the struggle in the community from Students who just graduated to graduates that struggle with studying and finding a career path in general. I have always been encouraging to people, sharing resources and counseling, but sadly I notice that the excitement soon quickly dies away, due to the fear that the community instills and the struggle it takes to start working programming and web-development industry in Sudan.

Employers and Work community here is a harsh place to be, it isn't fair at all. Universities here fail to teach the basic fundamentals that allow the students to succeed after graduating. I have been approached by many students that want me to do their final projects and pay me for it. I personally see this as a failed cause, I usually refuse to do the project, unless I get the chance to teach them while walking them through the project's completion, this way it's a win-win situation.

#### [The Pineal Developers Project](http://pinealdevelopers.com/)

*I founded*[ **Pineal Developers**](http://pinealdevelopers.com/) *in part to find people who have a passion and took Branding, Graphic Design, Illustration, Programming/Web Development and expose them to real-world projects and get paid as a freelancer.*

The Pineal Developers Project was supposed to start Nov 2020. The project was in its infancy, but it failed to get up and running due to the harsh economic environment and the outbreak of COVID-19.

We are a Team of 7 people who are working each in different parts of the industry.

I was planning to self-fund the project until it carried itself. Looking for partners and people who are willing to work as freelancers under the project and fund a large percentage of the revenue to cover the running cost. Sadly my dream to revive the Creative/Web-development industry slowed down to a halt.

**I am not giving up on the project**, rather I am working to find Partners and Investors, to push the project forward to support the Youth and build the Web Infrastructure here in Sudan and hopefully the world. I hope that through these personal projects I am able to get things back up and running again.

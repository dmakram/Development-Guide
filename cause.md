# Cause / Reason
There are many people in there teens to late 30s sometimes above that age, that are graduates of Computer Science or IT, that are looking for ways to find jobs. There is an economic struggle, and a lot of people are lost, looking for ways to make a basic income, and have a lot of trouble following the traditional Study/Career paths.

## Mission

I hope to at least guide people here in anyone to get a boost in learning from the free Resources and to begin experimenting in Web Development. I hope to show some sort of pathway so that they can at least try to follow and get an entire level job if not a basic income.

#### About Me

I am a Freelancer and I have seen the struggle in the community from Students who just graduated to graduates that struggle with studying and finding a career path in general. I have always been encouraging to people, sharing resources and counseling, but sadly I notice that the excitement soon quickly dies away, due to the fear that the community instills and the struggle it takes to start working programming and web-development industry in Internationally.

Employers and Work community here is a harsh place to be, it isn't fair at all. Universities here fail to teach the basic fundamentals that allow the students to succeed after graduating. I have been approached by many students that want me to do their final projects and pay me for it. I personally see this as a failed cause, I usually refuse to do the project, unless I get the chance to teach them while walking them through the project's completion, this way it's a win-win situation.

# Development-Guide

A collective of all the usable Documentation and little tools that can be used in web-development. Best Practices all in one place.

To Simplify we take the basic foundational concepts, arrange them in best practice and simplest form. Dissecting the languages to form almost like Lego pieces. These Lego pieces make the conceptual foundation of the idea that the programmer wants to achieve. 

Each Project has to have a Mood Board where the crucial media and Documentation from the client is planned out. Images for inspiration. And Brainstormed Ideas.

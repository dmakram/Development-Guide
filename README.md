# Development-Guide

A collective of all the usable Documentation and little tools that can be used in web-development. Best Practices all in one place.

This is a personal Project to share and help with some of my fellow beginner developer friends, better grasp and work using these things collected over years of learning the in's and out's of Web Development. I made it Public so that the community can help when there are things that can be changed or added.

To Simplify we take the basic foundational concepts, arrange them in best practice and simplest form. Dissecting the languages to form almost like Lego pieces. These Lego pieces make the conceptual foundation of the idea that the programmer achieves composes through writing code. Creatively composing the code, like writing and essay, poetry, and sometimes music. It takes a good grasp of the language and how its syntax work in modules or components that can then then be reused to decrease the amount of code written to achieve its objectives.

Each Project has to have a Mood Board where the crucial media and Documentation from the client is planned out. Images for inspiration. And Brainstormed Ideas.

There are more practical places to learn the basics of web development. The difference between what this development guide and [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), [codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/), and [General Assembly Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/) is that I am hoping to give a more focused approach to development. There are so many different Resources out there, this is more of a personal one based on my personal experience.

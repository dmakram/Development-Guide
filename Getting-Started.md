# Getting Started



### Start by Setting a Goal

A good Project generally starts with a good Idea, a criteria if you may of what you would like to achieve through to the final product. Many projects have a never ending version system because a lot changes through time. The Development industry moves fast generally because of the community contribution and the demand of new features and or objectives.

Coming from a designer background I usually sit and brainstorm what I would like to achieve using a Mind-Map, Drawing, or Mood-board, just so that I have a good idea where to start and what I might need.

### About this Guide

This Guide is what I wish I had at the beginning of my Web Development Journey. I wanted something like a manual where things were all in front of me, it would contain from rules to best practices snippets of code. So that I would go through, use what I need to create the project(s).

The learning curve in Web Development today, with all the industries, tools, frameworks and platforms, lead me to just make a simpler Criteria that can be simplified and would allow me to collaborate with others.

If I started a project I wanted anyone with the basic knowledge to be able to go through and easily pick up and work with out having to learn too much. I did so much research and practice over around 12 years, following up with many of the popular developers, but looking for something a more universal approach that will all allow more flexibility without loosing functionality.

### Seven Stages of Development

#### 1. Forming Vision

Figure out what you want from what you don't want. Make sure it the difference is as clear as the difference is Day from Night. Brain Storming and Creative Ideation process. Documenting this process is very crucial to making the final product phenomenal. 

For forming a vision I regularly use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), it give me all that I need in terms of Markdown. Obsidian is like a second brain, there are ways to build clusters of information and connect them to different parts and different tags or keywords. When you get used to the tools it has to provide and the [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/) language(which is used globally in multiple diciplines), allows you to take notes in a way we haven't been able to do in the past. It is important to build your own knowledge base, it becomes like your own second brand, keeping references and information in an organized manner as you work.

Using [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) helps the whole team send and receive smaller documents that can be quick to read, contain linked Images and contain Code or include other items that have to do with hierarchy.

*The ease to do those things with today's modern Markdown applications like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), [Typora](https://typora.io/), [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) and other Text/Code Editors(VS Code).*

#### 2. Planning Structure

Figure out all the Pieces and the Structures that will be at play. The Front-end the aspect the end user is going to interact with. And the Structures and inner workings, what happens in the background. What won't be seen but will be creating what is interacted with, The Back-end. 

When the Everyone in the team is involved the Structure is quickly inflated like a balloon people forming their own individual plans and collaborating with others forming a structure more specific to their own field of expertise. Breaking the project into different parts and becoming concrete building blocks that make up the foundation of the project. This is where a lot of the research happens, and the Ideation of the smaller more precise aspects of the project are formed before development.

#### 3. Development

Creating that which was planned and making sure it fits with the first two steps. Putting those little details in where the project should shine. This is where the project starts to take shape. This is the part where skill shines bright, its where implementation needs to be bolstered by best practices.

###### Two Sides to Web Development

Development is usually split in to two different parts, Front-End and Back-End.
The Front End is simply what the user sees in the final product, what the User interacts with first hand.
The Back End is more of what happens behind the scenes,like a store clerk that you go back to an organized store room to collect more items from stock or rearrange new arrival stock. 

In this Development Guide we are going to focus on a way that I have picked up through the years. I have worked to build a way that is easier to learn, and helps with the work flow when working on bigger projects that you will most likely be collaborating with others. Using [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [VS Code - Live Share](https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/collaboration/live-share)(I personally use Vim as my Code Editor, customize configuration to make things quick and smooth with my own shortcuts and others I've learned from long time developers, like [thePrimeagen](https://www.youtube.com/c/theprimeagein)),Â [Lunacy](https://icons8.com/lunacy) and much more.

#### [Front-End](https://github.com/dmakram/Development-Guide/tree/main/front-end)

When you open a website in your browser, the most common languages the browser is interpreting is HTML, CSS, and Javascript, these three languages are essential to web-development. They are what make Web-development what it is today. Javascript is used more for interactivity, so you will find that some websites use little to no JavaScript. There are other languages like SASS, LESS, Typescript, that have a more dedicated development pattern, in other words they translate or compile to be CSS and Javascript.

The Front-End Guide will cover [**HTML**](https://github.com/dmakram/Development-Guide/blob/main/front-end/HTML.md), [**CSS**, **SASS**(scss)](https://github.com/dmakram/Development-Guide/blob/main/front-end/CSS-SASS.md) and [**Javascript**](https://github.com/dmakram/Development-Guide/blob/main/front-end/JavaScript.md).

##### [Back-End](https://github.com/dmakram/Development-Guide/tree/main/back-end) - Coming soon...

#### 4. UI & UX - User Interface & User Experience

Tweaking the Users Journey so that the Visuals and the Functional Parts fits with the imagined end results. This where inspiration is created.

#### 5. Content

Adding the copy, making the processes and visuals fit with the text and the impressions that can be created by the storyline the journey outside of the application. Its what is passed what happens during the user experience.

#### 6. Testing and Deployment

Testing with the team seeing different perspectives and making sure that everything goes according the plan. This part of the process can be recycled again and again to ensure that the client gets what they want as the end result.

#### 7. Assessment

Observing the projects Success, it is like a final test to see how the project runs without our support. Over seeing the way things go after the project takes different use cases.

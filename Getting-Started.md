# Getting Started

## Start by Setting a Goal

A good Project generally starts with a good Idea, a criteria if you may of what you would like to achieve through to the final product. Many projects have a never ending version system because a lot changes through time. The Development industry moves fast generally because of the community contribution and the demand of new features and or objectives.

Coming from a designer background I usually sit and brainstorm what I would like to achieve using a Mind-Map, Drawing, or Mood-board, just so that I have a good idea where to start and what I might need.

## About this Guide

This Guide is what I wish I had at the beginning of my Web Development Journey. I wanted something like a manual where things were all in front of me, it would contain from rules to best practices snippets of code. So that I would go through, use what I need to create the project(s).

The learning curve in Web Development today, with all the industries, tools, frameworks and platforms, lead me to just make a simpler Criteria that can be simplified and would allow me to collaborate with others.

If I started a project I wanted anyone with the basic knowledge to be able to go through and easily pick up and work with out having to learn too much. I did so much research and practice over around 12 years, following up with many of the popular developers, but looking for something a more universal approach that will all allow more flexibility without loosing functionality.

## Two Sides to Web Development

Development is usually split in to two different parts, Front-End and Back-End.
The Front End is simply what the user sees in the final product, what the User interacts with first hand.
The Back End is more of what happens behind the scenes,like a store clerk that you go back to an organized store room to collect more items from stock or rearrange new arrival stock. 

In this Development Guide we are going to focus on a way that I have picked up through the years. I have worked to build a way that is easier to learn, and helps with the workflow when working on bigger projects that you will most likely be collaborating with others.

### [Front-End](https://github.com/dmakram/Development-Guide/tree/main/front-end)

When you open a website in your browser, the most common languages the browser is interpreting is HTML, CSS, and Javascript, these three languages are essential to web-development. They are what make Web-development what it is today. Javascript is used more for interactivity, so you will find that some websites use little to no Javascript. There are other languages like SASS, LESS, Typescript, that have a more dedicated development pattern, in other words they translate or compile to be CSS and Javascript.

The Front-End Guide will cover [**HTML**](https://github.com/dmakram/Development-Guide/blob/main/front-end/HTML.md), [**CSS**, **SASS**(scss)](https://github.com/dmakram/Development-Guide/blob/main/front-end/CSS-SASS.md) and [**Javascript**](https://github.com/dmakram/Development-Guide/blob/main/front-end/JavaScript.md).

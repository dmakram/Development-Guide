# UI & UX Design

Two Term that mean different aspects of Products and Presentation. These terms are the User Interface and User Experience.

The **User Interface** approaches the product in a different manner it tries to make a user-friendly design, a design that is easy to learn from the first interaction. The reason why many Applications have a similar design or framework system, is to recreate something that already works and is remembers from other user interactions.

The **User Experience** as a whole is the result of the user or consumer interacting with the product through time. Are the users satisfied with the outcome of the application achieves? Does the User grasp how to use the application with ease? Can it be Enjoyable?

Examples can be how to ride a bike, you can see the peddles, and you see the saddle, rubbers on the bar like handles of a knife or a maintenance tool. If you see someone riding it is easier for you to ride instantly. it is possible you ride different bikes but you wouldn't have such a long learning curve because the basics of riding are very similar to the first experience. This can also entail quality and material.



## Responsive Design

Designing an interface that would appear in a similar manner on different devices. In design and development that is were it can get complicated sometimes, but there are ways to approach the challenge. The example below shows different devices screens showing how the same page might appear in different screen sizes. This is where the designer needs to make important decisions depending on the importance of how things should appear unified. Font size might vary and image size might vary, but in each screen size there are uniform spacing conventions, made to keep the pages consistent through out a project. This should keep the brand design feel the same on different screen sizes.
